    <H>Don't classify, organize!</H>
    <p>
      Some people try to classify kozane. There is a misconception that kozane
      is a tool to categorize and store information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kozane is a tool to recombine and rearrange information. By doing this, we
      often find connections between kozane that seem to have nothing related to
      each other. After discovering unexpected relationships, kozane is
      organized into a structure that you did not anticipate beforehand.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      If you put the kozane into a rigid subjective classification, they will
      suffocate and die. Don't classify kozane by its content, but organize them
      by your personal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      (This page is a digest from a book by Tadao Umesao, who invented Kozane
      Method. Reference: "Classification is not the goal" from Tadao Umesao
      (1969) "The Art of Intellectual Production" p.57)

    <H>We need the practice to use stationery effectively</H>
    <p>
      You can use a pencil and a keyboard. You were not born with the ability to
      use that stationery. The stationery enhances human intelligence more than
      thinking without it. But to use it effectively, we need practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skills are not acquired by reading a textbook. They are developed by
      actually using the skill. Here I recommend some practices.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <b>Practice A:</b> In the previous tutorial, I made the contents of the
      tutorial into kozane. Add your thought as some kozane. And then
      re-organize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Practice B: </b>
      Read another article and create kozane from it. It should not be an
      instruction manual for a machine but an article that contains the author's
      opinion. Add your opinion as kozane. Then organize the whole kozane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Practice C:</b>Make 100 kozane about what you find fun and what you
      find interesting. Then organize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people will feel the practice C is easier than practice B. They are
      already familiar with expressing their thought. It is another important
      skill. Some people almost hung up with practice C. They even feel
      difficult to add their thought in A and B. In that case, try Practice D.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Practice D: </b>Read 3 articles and create kozane from them. Then
      organize the whole kozane. Choosing articles by the same author is easier
      than articles by different authors.
