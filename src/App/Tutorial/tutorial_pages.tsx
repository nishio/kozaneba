          later. In such a case, you can make such kozane temporarily invisible

    title: "We need the practice to use stationery effectively",
    body: (
      <div>
        <p>
          You can use a pencil and a keyboard. You were not born with the
          ability to use that stationery. The stationery enhances human
          intelligence more than thinking without it. But to use it effectively,
          we need practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skills are not acquired by reading a textbook. They are developed by
          actually using the skill. Here I recommend some practices.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Practice A:</b> In the previous tutorial, I made the contents of
          the tutorial into kozane. Add your thought as some kozane. And then
          re-organize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Practice B: </b>
          Read another article and create kozane from it. It should not be an
          instruction manual for a machine but an article that contains the
          author's opinion. Add your opinion as kozane. Then organize the whole
          kozane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Practice C:</b>Make 100 kozane about what you find fun and what you
          find interesting. Then organize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people will feel the practice C is easier than practice B. They
          are already familiar with expressing their thought. It is another
          important skill. Some people almost hung up with practice C. They even
          feel difficult to add their thought in A and B. In that case, try
          Practice D.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Practice D: </b>Read 3 articles and create kozane from them. Then
          organize the whole kozane. Choosing articles by the same author is
          easier than articles by different authors.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
